//! Sans-IO BTP session engine — RX reassembly + acknowledgement generation and
//! TX segmentation + flow control.
//!
//! Byte-grounded against connectedhomeip `src/ble/BtpEngine.cpp`
//! (`HandleCharacteristicReceived`, `HandleCharacteristicSend`,
//! `GetAndIncrementNextTxSeqNum`, `GetAndRecordRxAckSeqNum`, `HandleAckReceived`,
//! `IsValidAck`, `EncodeStandAloneAck`) and `BLEEndPoint.cpp` send-path /
//! window / timer semantics (`DriveSending`, `SendNextMessage`,
//! `ContinueMessageSend`, `PrepareNextFragment`, `AdjustRemoteReceiveWindow`).
//! Vectors: `test-vectors/btp/segments_rx.json`,
//! `test-vectors/btp/segments_tx.json`, `test-vectors/btp/standalone_ack.json`.
//!
//! # TX segmentation and flow control
//! [`BtpSession::queue_message`] hands one whole Matter SDU to the fragmenter;
//! [`BtpSession::next_gatt_write`] emits the next data fragment (respecting the
//! remote receive window and the one-GATT-op-in-flight rule) and
//! [`BtpSession::gatt_write_completed`] releases the in-flight latch. This
//! mirrors chip's `DriveSending`: a fragment is withheld while a GATT write is
//! outstanding, while the remote window is 0, or while it is 1 and there is no
//! pending acknowledgement to piggyback (chip
//! `BTP_WINDOW_NO_ACK_SEND_THRESHOLD`). Each departing data fragment debits the
//! remote window, consumes a TX sequence number, and (if not already awaiting
//! one) arms the 15 s ack-timeout — the exact registration a standalone ack
//! performs. A departing fragment piggybacks any pending receive ack (chip
//! `PrepareNextFragment` → `GetAndRecordRxAckSeqNum`): the `0x08` flag and ack
//! byte are added, the pending-ack state is cleared, and the local receive
//! window is reset to its maximum. An inbound ack credits the remote window per
//! chip `AdjustRemoteReceiveWindow`, re-opening a window that had closed.
//!
//! # Sans-IO discipline
//! [`BtpSession::on_indication`] NEVER returns outbound bytes. When a received
//! fragment makes an acknowledgement due (2.5 s send-ack timer, or immediately
//! when the local receive window is exhausted) it records that state so
//! [`BtpSession::poll_timeout`] surfaces the deadline and
//! [`BtpSession::handle_timeout`] emits the standalone ack. This mirrors
//! `matter-transport`'s MRP engine. A standalone ack is a full outbound
//! fragment: it consumes a TX sequence number and registers itself as an
//! outstanding unacknowledged fragment (chip `EncodeStandAloneAck` →
//! `GetAndIncrementNextTxSeqNum`, then `DoSendStandAloneAck` →
//! `StartAckReceivedTimer`), so it is itself subject to the 15 s ack-timeout
//! and a subsequent inbound ack for it is valid.
//!
//! # RX error mapping (chip error name → [`BtpError`])
//! Each RX vector maps to exactly one variant:
//! - `reassembler_incorrect_state` (a `Begin`/data fragment while a message is
//!   already mid-reassembly) → [`BtpError::ReassemblerInvalidState`]. We also
//!   fold chip's idle-non-`Begin` case (chip `INVALID_BTP_HEADER_FLAGS`) into
//!   this variant — a documented simplification; both kill the session.
//! - `invalid_btp_sequence_number` (a fragment/ack whose own sequence byte
//!   != `RxNext`) → [`BtpError::InvalidSequence`]. Chip checks this AFTER the
//!   piggyback ack, so a valid ack in the same packet is applied before the
//!   sequence check fails (`handle_ack_received_incorrect_sequence`).
//! - `invalid_ack` (standalone/piggyback ack when none is outstanding, or an
//!   ack for a sequence number outside the outstanding TX interval) →
//!   [`BtpError::InvalidAck`].
//!
//! # Fused receive+take (BLEEndPoint-stack semantics)
//! Chip's *engine* holds a completed message in `kState_Complete` until the
//! upper layer calls `TakeRxPacket`, which resets it to `kState_Idle`
//! (`BtpEngine.cpp:395-397`). In chip's *real* stack the take is synchronous:
//! `BLEEndPoint::HandleCharacteristicReceived` calls `TakeRxPacket` in the same
//! turn it observes `kState_Complete` (`BLEEndPoint.cpp:1278`), so a fresh
//! `Begin` for the next message is legal immediately after a completed one —
//! BTP flow control is fragment-based, so a peer may send up to `window`
//! fragments (hence two back-to-back single-fragment messages) before any ack.
//! Our [`BtpSession::on_indication`] fuses receive-and-take: it returns the
//! reassembled SDU and resets reassembly to idle in the same call, matching the
//! stack. A `Begin` arriving *mid-reassembly* (before the `End`) is still an
//! error. The `handle_characteristic_received_incorrect_sequence` vector
//! documents the engine-ISOLATION semantics (chip's unit test never calls
//! `TakeRxPacket`), which do not apply to a fused receive+take; its test is
//! rewritten to exercise the mid-reassembly `Begin` that IS reachable here.
