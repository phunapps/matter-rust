//! End-to-end happy path through the PUBLIC state-machine API, driven by
//! the captured matter.js fixture (`xtask capture-commissioning`): every
//! stage's response is the real captured device's bytes, attestation runs
//! the full verifier chain, and the walk must terminate in `Action::Done`
//! with the commissioned fabric's identity matching the fixture.
//!
//! Byte-parity on the emitted payloads is asserted separately by
//! `commissioning_byte_parity.rs`; this test pins COMPLETION via the same
//! public surface a production driver uses.

// Test-code carve-out: see CLAUDE.md.
