//! M6.4.4 — the state machine drives through the CSR + NOC flow on the
//! captured matter.js fixture: the real captured `CSRResponse` passes
//! `ValidateCsr` (self-signature, nonce echo, DAC attestation signature),
//! `GenerateNocChain` mints a NOC under this run's fabric, and after the
//! `AddNOC` response the cursor reaches `ReadNetworkCommissioningInfo`
//! (the next emitted action reads `NetworkCommissioning::FeatureMap`).

// Test-code carve-out: see CLAUDE.md.
