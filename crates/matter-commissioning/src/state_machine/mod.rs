//! Commissioning state machine.
//!
//! Cursor + switch-on-enum design modeled on
//! `project-chip/connectedhomeip`'s `AutoCommissioner`. Transport-agnostic
//! and sans-IO — emits cluster-command-level [`Action`]s that a driver wraps
//! in Invoke envelopes and routes via `matter-transport`. The crate's own
//! async driver (the `driver` feature) is one such caller; you can supply
//! your own instead.
