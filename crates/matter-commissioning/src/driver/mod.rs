//! Async Tokio commissioning driver — the IO layer beneath the sans-IO
//! [`Commissioner`](crate::Commissioner). Gated behind the `driver` feature.
//!
//! [`commission()`] is the entry point: it discovers the device, runs PASE,
//! then drives the state machine's [`Action`](crate::Action)s over the wire —
//! Invoke and Read round-trips, the CASE handshake, and the operational
//! mDNS resolve — through to a `CommissionedFabric`. [`commission_ble`] does
//! the same over a BLE (BTP) transport.
//!
//! The layers underneath are public too, so you can assemble your own flow:
//! [`AsyncDatagram`] is the transport seam, [`secured_round_trip`] and
//! [`secured_read`] are the exchange helpers, [`UnsecuredExchange`] is the
//! session-id-0 framing the PASE handshake runs over, and [`run_pase`] /
//! [`run_case`] are the handshake bridges.
