    ///   you already run removes that whole class of disagreement.

    ///   platform/embedded resolver that is better placed than we are to know
    ///   about interface changes, sleep/wake, and roaming.
    /// * **You are testing.** A deterministic test double lets you drive

    ///   network.
    ///
    /// # What your implementation is responsible for
    ///
    /// Implement [`matter_transport::Discovery`]; its own documentation is the
    /// contract. In short: `publish`/`unpublish` advertise and withdraw our
    /// services, and `query` → `poll_results` → `stop_query` is a browse whose
    /// records you buffer per handle and hand over on each drain. Read the notes
    /// on [`query`](matter_transport::Discovery::query) and
    /// [`stop_query`](matter_transport::Discovery::stop_query) about handle
    /// lifetime before you start — a handle that is never stopped keeps costing
    /// resources.
    ///
    /// The trait may also grow methods that carry a **default implementation**,
    /// so that adding one does not break existing implementors. Your type keeps
    /// compiling when that happens, but it silently takes the generic default
    /// until you override it — and a default is by definition the unrefined
    /// path (for instance, a fallback that browses every operational record
    /// rather than a narrowed subset). When you upgrade, check the trait for
    /// defaulted methods worth overriding.
    ///
    /// # Scope: this covers the controller's own resolution, not the servers
    ///
    /// The discovery you pass here is owned by the controller's actor task and
    /// is what every client operation resolves through — connecting to a node,
    /// commissioning, resubscribing.
    ///
    /// It is **not** used by the self-hosted server entry points
    /// ([`listen_for_checkin_once`](MatterController::listen_for_checkin_once),
    /// the `ota` feature's `serve_ota`, and the `unstable-provider` feature's
    /// `serve_provider_once`). Each of those runs
    /// off the actor on its own socket and needs a `Discovery` it exclusively
    /// owns for the duration of the call, which a single value moved into the
    /// actor cannot provide; they each construct their own `MdnsSdDiscovery`
    /// and use it only to publish and withdraw one operational record. So if
    /// you supply an Avahi-backed implementation and then serve OTA, your
    /// backend does the resolving while that record is still advertised through
    /// `mdns-sd`. If that matters to you, say so on [issue #113] — closing the
    /// gap means taking a discovery *factory* here rather than a value, and
    /// that is worth doing on demand rather than on speculation.
